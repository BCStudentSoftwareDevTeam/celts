(most likely will leave campus between 8am-9am, but more info to come) We plan to go to a homeless shelter that is in great need of repairs, decluttering, and cleaning up. We have listed a few of the projects that have been asked for:\r\n \r\nProject 1- The shelter has a sliding panel door leading to their electrical closet which they would like repaired. You\'d have to attach sliders to the bottom of the existing panel and fix the upper part of the frame so that it\'ll slide correctly.\r\nProject 2- The stairway/entrance to the shelter needs to be cleaned up a bit. They have stone stairs which need to be repaired a little bit. (instructions and guidance to be provided)\r\nProject 3- One of the door frames inside the bathrooms was removed for some plumbing work, which has since finished. They\'d like us to repair the wall and paint over it.\r\nProject 4- The second and third floors are a bit of a mess in terms of the floors and clutter everywhere. They\'d like us to try our best to get the floors cleaned and the materials organized. \r\n \r\nGiven that we will be handling tools, habitat for humanity will provide us with a quick training this Friday before the trip.
