    Service-Learning Course Designation/Active Learning Experience (ALE) Requirements Met Through Service-Learning
  </h2>
  <h4 class="pb-2">Criteria and Proposal Form</h4>
  <p>
    Service-Learning at Berea College is an educational experience based upon a collaborative partnership between College and community. Learning through service enables students to apply academic knowledge and critical-thinking skills to meet genuine community needs. Through reflection and assessment, students gain deeper understanding of course content and the importance of civic engagement.
  </p>
  <p>
    All Designated Service-Learning Courses will meet the Active Learning Experience (ALE) Requirement.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have questions about the criteria for Service-Learning Courses, please call Ashley Cochrane at x. 3605.
