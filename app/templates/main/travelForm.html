        <h2>Berea College CELTS Travel Form</h2>
        <h2>Student Responsibility and Insurance</h2>
        <h2>Statement</h2>
    </div>

    <a> 
        As a voluntary participant in Berea College CELTS programs, I acknowledge and agree to the following: 
    </a>    

    <a> 
        I will comply with the “Student Conduct Regulations” as stated in the Berea College Student Handbook 
        (<u>https://berea.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/student-handbook/</u>) and all other published policies of the College, 
        including all of CELTS' and Berea College's COVID-19 Policies.
    </a>
    <br> <br>
    <a> 
        I will also comply with the policies of behavior in the program as administered by CELTS Staff as representatives of Berea
        College. I understand that CELTS staff persons have the authority to discontinue my participation in the program, if it is
        judged my conduct is unacceptable.
    </a>
    <br> <br>
    <a> 
        I understand that travel presents certain inherent health risks. I am aware of my own medical/psychological needs and
        have consulted with a doctor about any health factor, medical or psychological, that might affect my ability to
        participate fully in the program. I have informed the appropriate CELTS Staff, in writing, of any conditions that could
        require special medical procedures while traveling.
    </a>
    <br> <br>
    <a> 
        In the event of injury or illness that prevents me from making decisions about medical treatment, program personnel
        will make every practical effort to obtain prior authorization from the party identified as my emergency contact.
    </a>
    <br> <br>
    <a>
        <strong>
            In all emergencies when prior authorization cannot be obtained from my emergency contact, I authorize any official
            representative of Berea College to secure medical treatment on my behalf, including surgery and the administration
            of an anesthetic, and I accept all financial responsibility for such treatment.
        </strong>
    </a>
    <br> <br>
    <a>
        I understand that I am required to have adequate health, accident, disability and hospitalization insurance to cover
        myself during participation in the program, and I have such insurance.
    </a>
    <br> <br>
    <a>
        I understand that activities and travel during free time in the program and following end of the program are at my own
        risk and expense. I agree to inform the Program Coordinator of my travel plans and understand that Berea College is not
        responsible for me while I am traveling independently during such free time.
    </a>
    <br> <br>
    <a>
        I further understand that I am solely responsible for any and all costs and consequences arising out of my voluntary or
        involuntary withdrawal from the program prior to its completion, including withdrawal caused by illness or disciplinary
        action by representative(s) of Berea College.
    </a>
    <br> <br>
    <a>
        In consideration of being afforded the opportunity to participate in this program, I, for myself, my heirs, successor or
        assigns, hereby release and hold harmless Berea College, its Board of Trustees, officers, agents, employees, students,
        and representatives from any and all claims, demands, causes of action or damages which may accrue on account of
        bodily or personal injury, property damage, or death arising out of my participation in the program, including damages,
        injury or death arising from the negligence of the aforesaid. 
    </a>
    <br> <br>
    <a>
        I have read and understand the provisions of this form and agree to be bound thereby.
